 First year PhD student studying in the School of Aerospace Engineering, at the University of Liverpool (UK. Having a background as a Geophysicist in the Earth Science department, my primary interests stem from how the use of computing can help solve conceptually difficult planetary based problems. \\
Dedicated to bridging the gap between between these two disciplines, my research is co-funded with the European Space Agency. The majority of my time will be spent defining the most effective radio science strategy for detecting high order gravitational anomalies in asteroids, and categorising what types of measurements can be achieved from \href{https://www.nasa.gov/what-are-smallsats-and-cubesats/#:~:text=What%20are%20CubeSats%3F,%2C%206%2C%20and%20even%2012U.}{\color{darkblue}{CubeSats}} operating in near proximity to asteroids.
