\begin{cvparagraph}
Growing up on a dairy farm in the UK, my hobbies and interests probably varied rather dramatically from what would be considered typical. I've grown up around both large animals and machinery, and spent a large proportion of my childhood outside. 
As a result, today my interests range from anything to do with working with my hands, to mechanical engineering, hiking, climbing and cycling! \\

An example of this would be in addition to climbing Mt Kilimanjaro in 2022, while I was apart of the Royal Air Force Air Cadets - back in 2018 I took part in an expedition to Mt Everest's Base Camp in Nepal. As a combined group of 21, we successfully climbed a nearby mountain, \href{https://maps.app.goo.gl/haqDGBrhwZV59Dht8}{\color{darkblue}{Kala Patthar}}, then took part in some additional voluntary manual labour work at nearby village monastery.
